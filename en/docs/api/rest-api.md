# REST APIs

Representational State Transfer (REST) is considered the standard for web APIs by the wider community. Choreo allows you to easily design, develop, and manage HTTP REST APIs using the integrated pro-code or low-code editor.  

## Design and Develop a REST API

Choreo, with its strong API Management capabilities, helps you implement and maintain your API strategy with ease. Choreo’s in-built user-friendly low-code and pro-code editors allow you to easily design and develop REST APIs in compliance with the OpenAPI specification. Once you design your API, you can then develop the business logic for your API by either writing your logic by scratch, by using an in-built connector, or a combination of both.

Choreo’s low-code editor helps design your REST API by giving a visual representation of the API’s resources. Furthermore, you can leverage the Ballerina language’s capabilities by making use of language constructs in the API design phase. Once you create a REST API component, similar to all other components, Choreo will create a private GitHub repo for your user account. You can then manage changes to your API via Git. The changes you make will be visible in the Choreo UI. 

You can write your logic from scratch by using the low-code editor that helps you focus on the business logic and not on the syntax or your fluency in the programming language while leveraging the programming language's capabilities. You can also use Choreo’s in-built connectors or simply re-use any other component you have already created within the Choreo platform. 

## Deploy your API 

You need to deploy the REST API to make your API invocable. Deploying an API in Choreo will check out the API’s source from your private Github repository, build it, push it to a docker container, and host it on Kubernetes. 

## Test your API
Testing your API before publishing it for consumers is highly beneficial to assure a smooth user experience. Choreo gives you multiple options to test your API. Apart from the integrated API console, you can either generate a cURL command or integrate Postman. 

## Manage your API
Choreo allows you to manage your API’s lifecycle visually. This helps you manage your APIs between the development, testing, and maintenance phases. 

## Document your API 
API documentation helps API subscribers to understand the functionality of the API and API publishers to market their APIs better and sustain competition. In Choreo, you can add different types of documentation from various sources. All documents created in Choreo have unique URLs to help improve SEO support.
