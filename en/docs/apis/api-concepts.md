# Concepts
Before you start managing APIs via Choreo, there are basic concepts that you need to understand. This section walks you through all the concepts you need to know. 
 
## API
An API in Choreo allows you to expose business functionality as a service to customers, partners, suppliers, and other stakeholders.

## API Management Components
Described below are the key components of Choreo API management:

### API Publisher 
The API Publisher is designed for API creators to develop, document, secure, test, and version APIs with ease.

### Developer Portal
The Developer portal allows API publishers to host and advertise their APIs while allowing API consumers to self-register, discover, evaluate, subscribe to, and consume APIs securely and easily.

### API Key Manager
API Key Manager handles all security and key-related operations. 

### API Gateway
API Gateway acts as the entry point for an API request. It secures, protects, manages, and scales API calls. 

## API Lifecycle
API lifecycle comprises of the stages an API goes through from creation to retirement. API lifecycle is independent of its backend service. The lifecycle states are `Created`, `Prototyped`, `Published`, `Deprecated`, `Blocked`, and `Retired`.
