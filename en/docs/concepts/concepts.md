# Concepts

This section describes the key concepts you need to understand to start working with Choreo.

### Project
A project is a virtual container that includes the integration solution of a cloud-native application. A typical integration solution in Choreo includes multiple Choreo components such as REST APIs, API proxies, triggers, WebSockets, scheduled tasks, etc. A project encapsulates these components for better organization, maintenance, and easy collaboration. You can add, modify, or delete any project component to continuously develop the integration solution. 


### Components
Components are the building blocks you can use to create an integration solution in Choreo.  A component in Choreo could be a REST API, an API Proxy, a trigger, a WebSocket, or a scheduled task. Choreoâ€™s componentization allows you to publish components to a Marketplace (currently supports only REST APIs and Triggers) and promotes component reuse. It increases productivity and makes collaborative integration development effortless.
